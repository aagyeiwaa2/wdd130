    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Agy</h2>
    
    <p>Hello everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Akosua Agyeiwaa and I am from Ghana (West Africa). I live in Kumasi but school in Winneba (it is two different regions). It is a tropical country as it is with African countries. I love reading (novels,inspirational books),watching movies and also listening to wholesome and inspiring music. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for eleven years and I had a privilege of serving in the Nigeria Benin Mission from 2017-2019. I absolutely love the temple and visit with every opportunity I get. I also love Prophet Nelson and sustain all leaders in the church. My favorite quote is "forget yourself and go to work" by President Gorden.B.Hinkcley.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing a degree to become a junior high school teacher in University of Education,Winneba and hope to complete next year. I love computers and technology and I have always been fascinated about it. With Â this fascination and interest, I have decided to pursue a degree in Applied Technology in BYU. I chose this degree path because of the numerous job opportunities and also to challenge myself out of my comfort zone. Making the best out of this program is what I hope to achieve by the end of the semseter. The things I love about BYU-Idaho and pathway in general are the mode of instructions and the structure of learning and teaching which is flexible.</p>
    <p>It is my pleasure to get to know each and everyone. Although I have choosen this degree path, I am totally new at this so all help highly welcomed. Thank you for looking at my web page. You can contact via email(akosuaagyeiwaa484@gmail.com) or on whatsapp (+233553091050/209518865).</p>
